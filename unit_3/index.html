		<p>Ile st Louis This is a more intimate and old world version of Ile de la Cite. Wander the narrow streets and imagine you have returned to ages past.
		In the summertime grab an icecream at the infamous BERTHILLON, or for wintertime warming, grab a hot chocolate at one of the tiny nook in the wall brasseries. Berthillon.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Square du Vert Galant If you and your beloved have tired feet, this is a stunning resting place at the tip of Ile de la Cite. This place, as well as most of the banks of the Seine, are spots for the lovers to lie down and kiss, take a nap, or discuss French philosophy. Well, mostly the former! French Philosphy</p>
